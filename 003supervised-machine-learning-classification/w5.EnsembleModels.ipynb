    "Ensemble models are a very popular technique as they can assist your models be more resistant to outliers and have better chances at generalizing with future data. They also gained popularity after several ensembles helped people win prediction competitions. Recently, stochastic gradient boosting became a go-to candidate model for many data scientists. This model walks you through the theory behind ensemble models and popular tree-based ensembles.\n",
