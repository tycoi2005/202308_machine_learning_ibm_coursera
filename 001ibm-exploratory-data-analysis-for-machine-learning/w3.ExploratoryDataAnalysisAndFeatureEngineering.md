# Exploratory Data Analysis
## Introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- EDA is going to be the approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods, and as we'll see what's statistical summary is as well. Why is this EDA useful? I want you to think of it as your initial conversation with a data before getting started. It's getting to know you face with your data set.
- Initial view of data

Techniques for EDA

- Summary Statistics: Average, Median, Min, Max, Correlations, etc.
- Visualizations: Histograms, Scatter Plots, Box Plots, etc.

Tools for EDA

- Data Wrangling: Pandas
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Sampling data
```python
# Sample 5 rows without replacement
sample = data.sample(n=5, replace=False)
# show all row and last three columns
print(sample.iloc[:,-3:])
```
