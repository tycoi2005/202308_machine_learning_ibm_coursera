# Data cleaning and feature engineering
- There is 2 strange users age 109 and 110, I removed them
- Convert sex(m/l) to is_male(True/False)
- Convert orientation to 3 columns (orientation_bisexual	orientation_gay	orientation_straight)
- With drink habit, I assigned a number for their frequency:
```
0 not at all
1 rarely
2 socially
3 often
4 very often
5 desperately
```
and assume 2985 people did not input alcohol habit as 2 (socially)
- Remove null height rows, remove strange height (<10)
- Split 'offspring' to two group: has kid and no kid (has_kid column)
- Assign people do not specify their language as english speakers
- Add columns language_count as number of languages that users can speak
```
language_count
1    29117
2    17227
3     8680
4     3249
5     1662
```
- remove negative income, and use log10 of income instead of income

- The filtered databases contains these columns ['age',
 'height',
 'income',
 'is_male',
 'orientation_bisexual',
 'orientation_gay',
 'orientation_straight',
 'has_kid',
 'language_count']


![age - income](./images/age_income.png "Age - Income")
(Age - Income chart)

![height - income](./images/height_income.png "Height - Income")

# Hypothesis

## Sexual orientation affect income

Ho: There is no different between income of straight and lgbt

Ha: There is difference between the income of straight people and lgbt people

![Straight vs lgbt income](./images/straight01.png "Straight vs lgbt income")

```python
t_value1 =  11.892619009095835 , p_value1 =  2.0022903264258819e-32

```

```

Conclusion: since p_value 2.0022903264258819e-32 is less than alpha 0.05

Reject the null hypothesis that There is no different between income of straight and lgbt.
```

## Gender affect income

Ho: There is no different between income of male and female

Ha: There is difference between the income of male and female

![Gender income](./images/gender01.png "Gender income")

```
Conclusion: since p_value2 2.0022903264258819e-32 is less than alpha 0.05

Reject the null hypothesis that There is no different between income of male and female.
```

## Language speak affect income

Ho: Income of people speak one, two, three or more language as the same

Ha: There is change when people speak more language


![languagecount - income](./images/languagecount_income.png "languagecount - Income")
(languagecount - Income chart)

![languages income](./images/language01.png "languages income")

```
p value 2.866821e-23 < 0.05 alpha, so we reject Ho that Income of people speak one, two, three or more language as the same
```
