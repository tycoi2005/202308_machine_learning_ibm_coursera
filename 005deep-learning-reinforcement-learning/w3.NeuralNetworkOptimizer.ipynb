    "You can leverage several options to prioritize the training time or the accuracy of your neural network and deep learning models. In this module you learn about key concepts that intervene during model training, including optimizers and data shuffling. You will also gain hands-on practice using Keras, one of the go-to libraries for deep learning. \n",
