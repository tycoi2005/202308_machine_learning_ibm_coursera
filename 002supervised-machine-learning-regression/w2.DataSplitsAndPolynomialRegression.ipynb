    "There are a few best practices to avoid overfitting of your regression models. One of these best practices is splitting your data into training and test sets. Another alternative is to use cross validation. And a third alternative is to introduce polynomial features. This module walks you through the theoretical framework and a few hands-on examples of these best practices.\n",
