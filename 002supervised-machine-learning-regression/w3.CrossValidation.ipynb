    "`Scikit Learn` library contains many methods that can perform the splitting of the data into training, testing and validation sets. The most popular methods that we covered in this module are:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   train_test_split - creates a single split into train and test sets\n",
    "\n",
    "*   K-fold - creates number of k-fold splits, allowing cross validation\n",
    "\n",
    "*   cross_val_score - evaluates model's score through cross validation\n",
    "\n",
    "*   cross_val_predict – produces the out-of-bag prediction for each row\n",
    "\n",
    "*   GridSearchCV – scans over parameters to select the best hyperparameter set with the best     \n",
