    "Having worked through some Regularization examples, let's examine intuitively how\n",
    "these techniques (Ridge, LASSO, Elastic Net) interact with modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several approaches to this interpretation:\n",
    "- The Analytic View\n",
    "  - Increasing L2/L1 penalties force coefficients to be smaller, restricting their plausible range.\n",
    "  - A smaller range for coefficients must be simpler/lower variance than a model with an infinite possible coefficient range.\n",
    "- The Geometric View\n",
    "![The Geometric View](./images/14_GeometricView.png \"The Geometric View\")\n",
    "![The Geometric View 2](./images/15_GeometricView.png \"The Geometric View 2\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Probabilistic View\n",
    "![The Probabilistic View](./images/16_TheProbabilisticView.png \"The Probabilistic View\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Letting f be the likelihood (probability of target given parameter vector $\\beta$),\n",
    "and $p(\\beta)$ the prior distribution of $\\beta$, we can calculate the posterior of $\\beta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$p(\\beta)$ is derived from independent draws of a prior coefficient density function $g$\n",
    "that we choose when regularizing.\n",
    "\n",
    "L2 (ridge) regularization imposes a Gaussian prior on the coefficients,\n",
    "while L1 (lasso) regularization imposes a Laplacian prior.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Prior is a belief you have on some quantity, typically on a set of parameters, without having any look at the data. If data is involved, the belief you have is updated and is called as posterior.\n",
    "\n",
    "In ridge regression, a gaussian prior on regression coefficients means that the coefficients are assumed to be distributed according to Gaussian/Normal distribution. Of course, one needs to assume mean and covariance structure as well.\n",
